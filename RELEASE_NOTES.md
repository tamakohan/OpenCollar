# Tama's OpenCollar Release Notes

For older release notes, check the official repository.

## 7.1.1

- Renamed "OwnSelf" to "Vanilla".
  - Changed the messages that are displayed when Vanilla is turned on or off to something a little more friendly.
  - Changed the output of "Access List" to not include the wearer in the owner list, and to print whether Vanilla is enabled on a separate line.
  - Changed the messages that are printed when you log in to not include the wearer in the owner list. I also removed the [serial comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma).
- Made the Main Menu look more like Wendy's "Peanut" release.
  - It will display the Locked/unlocked status, "Main Menu", "Tama's OpenCollar" and the version number, the prefix, channel and safeword, and a quote if one is set.
  - Currently there is no way to set the quote via menu or command (but I hope to add this soon). The only way to get a quote to show up at the moment is to be using a Wendy's Distribution collar, go to Settings > Print, copy the settings into your .settings notecard, then migrate to Tama's OpenCollar and load the settings. (Or enter the quote into your .settings manually, but this feature is primarily intended for those migrating from Wendy's Distribution.)
